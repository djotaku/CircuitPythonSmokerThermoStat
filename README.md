# CircuitPython-based Smoker Thermostat

This is an evolution from what I started [here](https://github.com/djotaku/BBQThermostat) with Arduino. I'm moving towards using CircuitPython instaed. 

The project as a whole is [documented on Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/166703-bbq-thermostat) although I have some updates to make based on the switch to CircuitPython.
